    </p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 pound) fully cooked, bone-in ham</li>
        <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place ham, cut-side down, into a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Cut skin off pineapple with a sharp knife and slice off any brown spots or skin left behind. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick rings and use a round cutter to remove cores. Pin rings onto ham with toothpicks.</li>
        <li>bake ham for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While ham bakes, mix pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power until glaze is boiling and slightly thickened. Work carefully because glaze will be sticky and very hot.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the glaze evenly over ham and pineapple rings. Bake ham for 30 minutes more, then pour remaining glaze over ham.</li>
        <li>Continue baking ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 30 to 60 minutes more.</li>
        <li>enjoy!</li>
